# Password-Generator

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I have taken great care to create a simple, but effective password generator. 

I have created a password generator that gives the user the option of changing the length, whether or not the are upper or lowercase letters, whether or not there are symbols, and whether or not there are numbers. 

This password generator improves the security of our company. 

I went through great effort to create this password generator. 

In the future I should add more commits, rather commit all at once. Small commits are important for working on a team, so that it's clear, if there are bugs, what commits caused the bugs. 


I used the Paletton (http://paletton.com/#uid=13u0u0kCAoD6YC+qwuUP5gT+h4k) color tool to create a color scheme. I was inspired by family vacations to the Badlands of south Dakota, particularly the many shades of dust and dirt in the desert sunlight. 

I deleted a lot of css, on the bases that whether or not it was present, nothing changed in the GUI. 
In the future I'd like to examine if the CSS I deleted had an effect that was not obvious.

My biggest unsolved issue in this has been proper formatting of the checkboxes.
